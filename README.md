# Feedreader Test
### About this project
This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I have used the starter code from Udacity and the Jasmine framework to write a series of test suites to test out certain functionalities.
### Getting Started
1. Downlaod the repo.
2. Open index.html to view the functionality of the application within your browser.
### What you can do
1. Explore the application's HTML (./index.html), CSS (./css/style.css) and JavaScript (./js/app.js) to gain an understanding of how it works. your can also edit these files to add functionality of the application.
2. Edit the Jasmine spec file in ./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js to test out your newly added functionality.
